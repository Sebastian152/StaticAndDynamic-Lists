# OOP C++/C for VSCode
This is a template for running OOP C++/C code on Visual Studio Code.

## To run this code with visual studio code
1. Press **CTRL + P.**
2. Type in the keyboard "**>Run Task**" and Select "**Tasks: Run Task**".
3. Run the task called "**Build and Run all**".

If you want a snippet to run this task faster you can bind the task to a key of your keyboard, or a special mouse button.
*Don't delete* the .vscode folder, as it contains the tasks to compile all the different c++ files and run the main.cpp in the integrated terminal.
